The workload became intense and by the fact that I had not done programming in high school, put on a lot of pressure on me. There was a time where I wanted to dropout because I had failed some of my 3rd year modules. However, despite the challenges, I told myself that no matter how long it takes me to obtain this degree, I will make sure to complete it. "
